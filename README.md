React.js Workshop with Ryan Florence
====================================

You will need

```
git clone https://github.paypal.com/jacharles/react-training.git
cd react-training
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080.

This runs the webpack dev server, any changes you make to javascript
files in `excercises` will cause the browser to reload live.
